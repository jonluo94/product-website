Our policy lasts 30 days from the date of ship. If 30 days have gone by since the ship date, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging. Returns must include the packing slip that arrived with your product. Personalized product is exempt from being returned. If there are no defects in the product and it has been personalized we will not except the product on return. To complete your return, we require the packing slip that was shipped with your product.

Your packing slip doubles as return slip.  Please check which items you are returning and include slip with your shipment.

To return your product, you should contact us by email. You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable.  If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will not be included in refund. Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you may vary.
